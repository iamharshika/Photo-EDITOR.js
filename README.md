# Photo-EDITOR.js
A web application where users upload an image, do operations like rotate, resize, flip and grey-scaling and
download the transformed image.
Transformed every image ( a 3-D array ) to a 1-D array, manipulated its characteristics ( RGB and dimensions )
and showed a transformed image in an HTML canvas.
Resolved the issues caused by the improper ratio of final and initial dimensions by using Sampling.
